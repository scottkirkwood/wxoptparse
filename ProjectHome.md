`wxOptParse` is a Python program that brings up a graphical representation of the options that another python program has for the command line, via the optparse module.

What this means is that if if you have a program that uses optparse you can click on checkboxes, edit boxes, combo boxes, etc. instead of using the command line.

So instead of this:

```
usage: mytest.py [options]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILENAME, --file=FILENAME
                        Enter a filename
  -p PATH, --path=PATH  Enter a path
  -2 FILENAME2, --noHelp=FILENAME2
  -n NUMBER, --count=NUMBER
                        Enter a number
  -m FLOAT, --float=FLOAT
                        Enter a floating point number
  -b, --bool            Switch to true
  --nbool               Switch to false
  --choice=CHOICE       Choice
```

## Features ##

Cross-platform. Should work on Windows, Linux, Unix, or Mac.
Absolutely no changes required for the program you want to run.
You can continue to use the program at the command line as well.
Boolean flags shown as checkboxes.
String options that use the word "file" add a file browser button.
String options that use the work "path" or "folder" add a path browser button.
Choices are shown as a combo box.
Your most recently used choices are used by default.
A history of your previous items are stored.
There's a sample of how you can run any program through wxOptParse, not just a python program. See wxFind.
Dependencies

`wxPython 2.5.3` or greater. (http://www.wxpython.org)
`elementtree 1.2` or greater (http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm)
`Python 2.4` (untested in 2.3). (http://www.python.org)

## Installing ##

Choose one of the following methods. In all cases you probably need to run as root.

### Egg Download ###

easy\_install.py wxoptparse

### Egg File ###

easy\_install.py wxOptParse-0.1.2-py2.4.egg

### Easy Install Zip ###

easy\_install.py wxOptParse-0.1.2.zip

### Normal Python Install ###

unzip wxOptParse-0.1.2.zip
cd wxOptParse-0.1.2
python setup.py install


## Running ##

If you want to run your program you should be able to type:

$ wxoptparse myprogram.py

Assuming your program is called myprogram.py

There's a sample program installed called wxFind which runs the GNU find command, if available. The source code shows you how it is done. Unfortunately, GNU's find doesn't use the standard style of parameters so some handling of the parameters needs to be done, but it is still quite useful.

### To Do ###

A way to use your recent items (combo box) - currently it shows the lastvalue used.
Allow you to change your program so that it uses, optionally, wxOptParse.
A method to force an option's items type (like whether it is to browse for file/folder)
Ability to reset the options to the defaults.
Ability to save a set of settings and give it a name.
Use radio buttons when appropriate.
Use tooltips
Run the ouput in a sub-window (I tried but wasn't able to do it).
